In 2018 I had an online bake sale fundraiser for the ALS Association.  I had designed a website through weebly 
(https://davidrexfordlegacy.weebly.com) that I used to raise money and spread awarenss on the disease. For my project I would 
like to try and recreate this website but this time code and build the entire website myself insgtead of using an app like weebly.
